# Welcome to CampgroundProbe
By applying the knowledge from the web dev courses I took, I created this Web App called **CampgroundProbe**, where it is possible to share, search and view campgrounds around Brazil (similar to airbnb). This application has a full  CRUD operations Implemented, it also has authentication, and the user can register their own campground. The provided address is converted to latitude and long longitude and plotted in a map through geocoding. Note that the presented campgrounds are fictional created just for practice. 

This application was basically built using:

 - HTML
 - EJS
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap
 - JavaScript
 - Node
 - Express
 - MongoDB
 - Mongoose
