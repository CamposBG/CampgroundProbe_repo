![](figures/yelp_camp_home.png)
By applying the knowledge from the web dev courses I took, I built this Web App called **YelpCamp**, where it is possible to share, search and view campgrounds (similar to airbnb). This application has a full  CRUD operations Implemented, it also has authentication and the user can register their own campground. The provided address is converted to latitude and long longitude and plotted in a map through geocoding. **Note that this application was created just for learning purposes.**
